## **4. Key Findings**
### **Exploratory Analysis**
- Significant seasonal patterns were observed in trading volumes.
- Trends indicate volatility spikes during specific months.

### **Model Performance**
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): `280.800`
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): `186515.14`
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): `431.87`

### **Predictions**
- Predicted stock prices align closely with actual prices, showing the model's reliability.
- Error trends reveal potential overfitting in certain time periods.
